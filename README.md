# Unit 12 Homework: Eat Safe, Love
Bootcamp: UTA-VIRT-DATA-PT-02-2023-U-LOLC-MWTH(B) Challenge 12

For this project, I analyzed JSON data for a food magazine, *Eat Safe, Love*, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. I used a MongoDB database to sort, filter, and analyze the data to produce reports for the *Eat, Safe, Love* magainze.
